# Example usage:

# Example 1
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(solution.twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]

# Example 2
nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
print(solution.twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [1, 2]

# Example 3
nums = [3, 3]
target = 6
print(solution.twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
